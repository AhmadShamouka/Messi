                Messi's football journey began at a young age, playing for the youth team of his local club, Newell's Old Boys. However, at the age of 13, he relocated to Barcelona, Spain, to join FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia. It was here that he would rise through the ranks and eventually make his debut for the first team in 2004. Over the next 17 years, Messi would become the face of FC Barcelona
                 and one of the most iconic figures in the club's history.
